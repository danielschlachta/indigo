## about

Having created the static version of a page as a design study, I then 
peppered it with some php to make it a little more flexible (mainly for 
the navigation.) Later I added code to generate dynamic content, for 
example to have a blog-like thing on the main page.

In the end I wanted to have the programming separate from the rest so 
that I could easily change or extend my site. I also wanted to try out 
earlier designs with the same content.

After looking at several existing solutions none of them seemed flexible 
enough, so I decided to consolidate the code I already had into some 
sort of framework.

This is the result.
