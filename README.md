a somewhat different php framework for generating dynamic web pages

## about

After having created a static version as 
a design study, I then peppered it with some php to make it a little more flexible.
In the end I wanted to have the programming separate from the content so that I could easily 
change or extend my pages. After looking at several existing solutions none of them seemed
flexible enough, so I decided to consolidate the code I already had into some sort of framework.

This is the result.
